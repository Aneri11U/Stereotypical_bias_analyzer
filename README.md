# **Stereotypical Bias Analyzer**

In this project, we analyzed biases across ten domains using four datasets and compiled a comprehensive dataset from publicly available sources. Models such as BERT and RoBERTa were employed to identify significant biases, underscoring the necessity of eliminating bias in natural language processing. Users can input a sentence to determine its bias types.

### **Stereotypical Bias**

Stereotypical bias, a pervasive cognitive phenomenon, continues to influence perceptions, decisions, and behaviors across a wide range of human interactions. Given that pre-trained language models are trained on vast real-world datasets, there is concern that these models could inadvertently incorporate and reinforce stereotypical biases.

### **Bias Types**

Identifiable bias types from our study & project:

The biases are labeled as follows:

- **Race/Color (0)**
- **Socioeconomic (1)**
- **Gender (2)**
- **Disability (3)**
- **Nationality (4)**
- **Sexual Orientation (5)**
- **Physical Appearance (6)**
- **Religion (7)**
- **Age (8)**
- **Profession (9)**

Enter any sentence related to these labels and check the bias type of the sentence.
