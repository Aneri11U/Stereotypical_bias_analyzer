# Stereotypical_bias_analyzer
In this project, we analyzed biases in ten domains using four datasets and prepared a useful dataset based on all publicly available datasets. Models like BERT and RoBERTa reveal significant biases, highlighting the importance of eliminating bias in natural language processing. Users can input a sentence to determine its bias types.
