# Stereotypical_bias_analyzer
In this project, we analyzed biases in ten domains using four datasets and prepared a useful dataset based on all publicly available datasets. Models like BERT and RoBERTa reveal significant biases, highlighting the importance of eliminating bias in natural language processing. Users can input a sentence to determine its bias types.

**Stereotypical bias :**
Stereotypical bias, an extensive cognitive phenomena, continues to impact perceptions, decisions, and behaviors across a wide range of human interactions.Because pre-trained
language models are quite prominent and are trained on large real-world datasets, there are concerns that these models could incorporate and reinforce stereotypical biases.
